## Character Randomizer

Creates a random character with gender, race, hair colour and a physical attribute (e.g. old, young, tall, short.)

`python character_randomizer/character_randomizer.py`

## Name Generation

Being able to quickly create names is an important skill every DM should master. That, or you can make a computer do it for you.
The `names` directory contains useful scripts for generating population-specific names (e.g. dwarven names)
